# Impetus Sandbox
This is part of a project built in 72 hours for the [Venture Labs Telescope](http://labs.venturedept.com) competition. The full project can be seen [here](http://impetus.space)

It uses the [PhysicsJS](https://github.com/wellcaffeinated/PhysicsJS) engine to compare the mass and size of the different planets in the solar system.
